# Definition

> A media query consists of a media type and at least one
> expression that limits the style sheets' scope by using
> media features, such as width, height, and color. Media
> queries, added in CSS3, let the presentation of content
> be tailored to a specific range of output devices without
> having to change the content itself.

# Predefined media queries

We defined several media queries/breakpoints. You can use them with the
[respond mixin](/development/mixins/respond.html).
