#Â Icon collection

This folder contains the icons for this style guide.
All icons must be in the SVG format and have to fulfil an exact
naming convention. This is because the SVG icons are transformed
automatically into an icon font.

## Naming

If you look at the icons names, you'll notice the following
naming structure.

```
uE001-example.svg
```

There are two very important fragments contained in this naming
scheme, which are described in the following table.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>fragment</th>
    <th>description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>uE001</td>
    <td>The code point of the icon, prefixed with an `u`.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>example</td>
    <td>A meaningful and identifying name for the icon.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
